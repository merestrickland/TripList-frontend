## TripList
TripList is a web application that allows a user to plan trips for themselves, or share trips with others. Itinerary items are split into categories including where to eat, where to drink, and things to do.

## Motivation
This project exists because of how often I have people asking for my recommendations in cities they will visit. On TripList, you can search for users and easily see what items they recommend for trips they have been on.
